# IRIS-Flower-classification

We all know about Iris Dataset, and it contains features of different flower species. Independent features in this dataset are Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. All these lengths were in centimeters. And Dependent feature, which will be the output for the model, is Species. It contains the name of the species to which that particular flower with those measurements belongs.

### The dataset contains a set of 150 records under 5 attributes
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Sepal Length
- Sepal width
- Class(Species)

This Project is thorugh application of machine learning with python programming.
It focuses on IRIS flower classification using Machine Learning with different ML Models. 

Dependencies:

    Python3
    Numpy
    Pandas
    Matplotlib
    UnSupervised Learning
    Machine Learning Algorithm
    Classification Algorithms
    
This Notebook will show basic examples of:

    Data Handling
    Importing Data with Pandas
    Cleaning Data
    Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib

    
Here some of algorithm are used that are some types of machine learning subparts algorithms of supervised and Unsupervised learning.
Algorithm used for predicting and get accuracy are -
1. Logistic Regression
2. K nearest Neighbors
3. Naive Bayes
4. Support Vector Machine
5. Decision Tree
6. Random Forest
7. metrics
8. train_test_split
9. Conclusion

   
We are making accuracy and prediction in Iris project through Iris Dataset.

This is easy and understable for machine learning staters( Naive ).
